An Introduction to Deep Learning
The Definition of Deep Learning
Deep learning is a machine learning approach that utilises multi-layered neural networks to process data and solve problems. These networks imitate the structure and function of the human brain, consisting of interconnected neurons that receive and transmit signals to perform calculations. Deep learning involves numerous layers, enabling the extraction of abstract features from complex data. It excels at handling high-dimensional and nonlinear information, such as images, speech, text, and video, often achieving or surpassing human-level performance. However, it necessitates substantial computing power, data, and appropriate network configurations and parameters. [1, 2]
Applications of Deep Learning
Deep learning has achieved significant breakthroughs in various fields, notably in computer vision. This domain focuses on enabling computers to comprehend and process images and videos. Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied to tasks such as image classification, object detection, face recognition, image segmentation, and image generation. Image classification involves assigning categories to images, while object detection identifies objects and labels their locations and categories within an image. Face recognition determines the identity of a person or finds similar faces in a database. Image segmentation divides an image into regions and assigns labels to each region. Additionally, deep learning enables image generation, allowing the creation of new images based on certain conditions or descriptions, such as style transfer, cartoonisation, and super-resolution.
